Twitter bot

Twit Feed Bot is a Twitter bot that uses an RSS feed and a sentence from Wordnik to update a Twitter Status. It also uses Wordnik to bother a random Twitter user. The bot can also respond to @ messages. 

Things to improve: Retweet, favourite, add a follower, etc.

You will need to create an app at apps.twitter.com and get your oAuth keys from there. You will also need a Wordnik API key from developer.wordnik.com. 

**WARNING** Be aware that some features of this bot violate Twitter's Terms and Conditions, found at https://support.twitter.com/articles/76915. Your Twitter account may be suspended if you run this bot.
