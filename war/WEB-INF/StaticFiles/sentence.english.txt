and go on, and take by admittance, that which they cannot make good. 
Some, whatsoever is beyond their reach, will seem to despise, 
or make light of it as impertinent

will conclude this first fruit of friendship
communicating of a man's self to his friend, works two contrary effects
for it redoubleth joys, and cutteth griefs in halves

virtue as the alchemists use to attribute to their store
body; that it worketh all contrary effects, but still to the good men
benefit of nature. But yet without praying in aid of alchemists

of thoughts. Neither is this to be understood only of faithful counsel
which a man receiveth from his friend; but before you come to that
certain it is, that whosoever hath his mind fraught with many thoughts
his wits and understanding do clarify and break up, in the communicating
and discoursing with another; he tosseth his thoughts more easily
turned into words: finally, he waxeth wiser than himself
by an hour's discourse, than by a day's meditation. It was well said
by Themistocles, to the king of Persia, That speech was like cloth

such friends as are able to give a man counsel; (they indeed are best ;)
but even without that, a man learneth of himself

Mechanism in physics is favourable to liberty in politics and morals:

The Protestant and revolutionary independence here gives us a foretaste
But she was moderate even in his radicalisms
A human nature totally fluid would of itself have proved anarchical
but in order to stem that natural anarchy it was fortunately possible 
to invoke the conditions of prosperity and happiness
Strictly laid down by the Creator!
The improvidence and naughtiness of nature was called to book at every turn 
by the pleasures and pains divinely appended to things enjoined and to things forbidden
and ultimately by hell and by heaven 
Yet if rewards and punishments were attached 
to human action and feeling in this perfectly external and arbitrary fashion
whilst the feelings and actions spontaneous in mankind counted for nothing 
in the rule of morals and of wisdom
we should be living under the most cruel and artificial of tyrannies
and it would not be long before the authority of such a code
would be called in question and the reality of those arbitrary rewards 
and punishments would be denied, both for this world and for any other.
In a truly rational morality moral sanctions would have to vary 
with the variation of species

its natural joy in a new way of life
The monsters would not be monsters except to rustic prejudice

since those staid conventions themselves would have become obsolete
Nature would henceforth present nothing but pervasive metamorphosis

To correct the weariness of such pure flux we might indeed invoke the idea of a progress
evolution towards something always higher and better
but this idea simply reinstates, under a temporal form
the dominance of a specific standard to which nature is asked to conform
Genera and species might shift and glide into one another at will 
but always in the authorised direction
If, on the contrary, transformation had no predetermined direction
we should be driven back, for a moral principle

as in estimating the correctness or beauty of language we appeal to the speech 
and genius of each nation at each epoch
without imposing the grammar of one language or age upon another
It is only in so far as, in the midst of the flux, 
certain tropes become organised and recurrent
that any interests or beauties can be transmitted from moment to moment 
or from generation to generation
Physical integration is a prerequisite to moral integrity
unless an individual or a species is sufficiently organised 
determinate to aspire to a distinguishable form of life
eschewing all others
that individual or species can bear no significant name
can achieve no progress, and can approach no beauty or perfection
Thus, so long as in a fluid world there is some measure of life and organisation
monsters and changelings will always remain possible physically and regrettable morally
Small deviations from the chosen type or the chosen direction of progress 
will continue to be called morbid and ugly
and great deviations or reversals will continue to be called monstrous

circumstance is that the new theories seem to be affected

The other circumstance which points to further revolutions is social

and no intellectual surfeit or discouragement
called science, in contrast to all personal philosophies

That the end of life is death may be called a truism

Certainly there is a consent between the body and the mind

Therefore it is good to consider of deformity not as a sign
which is more deceivable
but as a cause, which seldom faileth of the effect
Whosoever hath anything fixed in his person

So that upon the matter, in a great wit
deformity is an advantage to rising
Kings in ancient times (and at this present in some countries)
were wont to put great trust in eunuchs

And much like is the reason of deformed persons
Still the ground is, they will, if they be of spirit
seek to free themselves from scorn
which must be either by virtue or malice
